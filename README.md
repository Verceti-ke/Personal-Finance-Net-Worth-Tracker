# Personal Finance (Net Worth Tracking) Spreadsheet

## What is it?

A simple to use spreadsheet (Google Sheets/Excel) advanced spreadsheet/app for personal finance management, net worth tracking, money management, financial goals and FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early).

## Why is it?

After looking around online for something suitable to track personal finance, and seeing the people of Reddit using their own various spreadsheets (r/FinancialIndependence, r/FireUK, r/PersonalFinance) - So I decided to put this spreadsheet together... I'm a programmer not a financial advisor and wanted a better way to manage personal finances, but don't have the time or capital to put together a full web-app just yet.

This spreadsheet is free to use (at your own peril!), the more people use it and provide feedback the better we can make it. I'll publish updates as I find the time - donations are welcome if you would like to support the project! :)

Designed for British Pounds in the UK (GBPÂ£) - but I'm sure it could work for other currencies/countries too.
Make sure to check for new versions as they may include bug fixes, improvements and new features!

## When is it?

Still very much in the early stages, works for basic usage currently - getting the public release ready now and will be added to the repository soon. 2019-01-06.

Hoping to grow the features with feedback and advice from the community! :)
